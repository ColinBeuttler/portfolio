            <p id="bodytext">My name is Colin Beuttler, I am a recent graduate of UCI's coding boot camp and I have
                created this site in order to show off a few of my past projects. The sites featured are projects I
                worked on with others in order to sharpen my skills as a Developer. In the past I have used many
                technologies such as
                jQuery, React, and Parallax. I am constantly looking into new technologies and enjoy learning about
                their
                strengths and trade offs. If you have any questions for me or want to know more about any of my
                experiences or the technologies on this site I have included my email as well as a contact form at the
                bottom of this page.

            <p class="techspecs">A jQuery effect that is used to scroll either images or animations as the user scrolls.
                I have used parallax in the past and have always been impressed with the difference it an make on my
                wesites. It adds motion to otherwise lifeless pictures.

            <p class="techspecs">Pure CSS is a lightweight and responsive framework that features a very clean and
                minimalistic aesthetic. This website was my first exposure to Pure, I used in hopes it would bring
                subtle style changes to my site.</p>

            <a class="button-red" href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
            <p class="techspecs">jQuery is a lightweight and fast library used with JavaScript. I've used jQuery in the
                past and
                found it to be very helpful. I especially like using it in conjunction with parallax.</p>

                <p class="techspecs"> This Blog was designed for users to post current weather conditions within their
                    area. I mostly
                    worked
                    on the blog form, connecting it to the backend and the UI. My favorite part of this site was our
                    use of parallax. It was my first time I had ever used it and was the main reason I included it
                    into my portfolio.

                <p class="techspecs">This app was designed to help users determine which restaurants around them they
                    could dine in
                    with their dogs. This was my first introduction to react.
                    I was tasked with the tile puzzle and the backend of the login. I had not made any games with
                    JavaScript, let alone React, but I was really pleased with the end. I hope to include other
                    puzzle games such as this one in many future projects.
